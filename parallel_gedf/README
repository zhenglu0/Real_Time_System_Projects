This software allows the user to execute a real-time parallel workload
using the theory and practice developed in "Practical Real-Time Scheduling
for Parallel Tasks ---- from Theory to Platform"

Using this software requires writing real-time tasks in a special way that
does not include a main function. A sample of such a task can be found in
simple_task.cpp, and the special method of invocation is in
run_simple_taskset.sh.

A user guide may be found at prt.wustl.edu/clustering_user_guide.docx

Note that invoking tasksets with this software requires that one have
administrative privliges to create threads and set real-time priorities. 

This software is still under development- please feel free to contact the 
authors for further guidance.
